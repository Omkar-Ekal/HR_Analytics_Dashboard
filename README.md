# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns using data from an organization's Human Resources database. The goal is to identify factors contributing to employee turnover, such as age, gender, education level, salary, and tenure, and use this information to provide actionable insights that can help improve employee retention strategies.

## Project Summary
This project focuses on the development of an **Employee Attrition Analytics Dashboard** to visualize and analyze employee data. The dashboard includes various data visualizations like bar charts, donut charts, and matrices to present insights about employee attrition. Key metrics analyzed include:
- Attrition rates based on **age**, **gender**, and **education level**.
- Attrition trends by **salary slab** and **years at the company**.
- Job role-specific attrition patterns.

The insights generated from this dashboard are intended to help organizations understand the causes of employee turnover and make informed decisions to reduce attrition and improve workforce engagement.
